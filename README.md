# elm-quiz
A toy quiz system written in Elm.

I'm just playing about with the Elm language. I thought a little quiz would be a good project to experiment with.

At the moment, the Elm standard library (and even the community packages) don't offer much, so this implements some very basic things.

To build it, run `elm-make quiz.elm --output=quiz.js`, then open `index.html`.
